## ‚ú® Project Overview

MazeCrafter is an interactive algorithm visualization tool that brings classic maze generation and pathfinding algorithms to life. Users can generate intricate mazes of customizable sizes using various algorithms and then watch as different solver algorithms navigate the labyrinth to find the solution.

This project serves as an educational and entertaining way to understand the mechanics behind fundamental computer science algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A*.

## ‚≠ê Core Features

* **Multiple Generation Algorithms:** Generate mazes using different techniques, such as:
    * **Recursive Backtracking (DFS):** Creates mazes with long, winding corridors.
    * **Prim's Algorithm:** Produces mazes with many short branches.
* **Multiple Solving Algorithms:** Visualize and compare different pathfinding algorithms, including:
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Guaranteed to find the shortest path.
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores one path deeply before backtracking.
    * **A\* Search Algorithm:** An intelligent algorithm that finds the shortest path much faster.
* **Customizable Grid:** Easily adjust the size of the maze grid to create simpler or more complex challenges.
* **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Watch the entire process unfold in real-time, with clear visual cues for the current path, visited cells, and the final solution.
